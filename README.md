# Racker Up

This is a series of exercises to familiarize myself with Rackspace's OpenStack API, using Ruby, [HTTParty](http://httparty.rubyforge.org/rdoc/) and [fog](https://github.com/fog/fog). It might be useful to someone as a reference, too.

## API

These exercises use the API directly.

`raw-api.rb` uses the authentication endpoint to create a token.
